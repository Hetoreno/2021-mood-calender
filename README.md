# 2021 Mood Calendar

A small Javascript website that I seen by Florin Pop in his #100 days of code & gave me the inspiration in doing the same project as quick a possible to test my knowledge with Javascript.

I would see this project a great benefit for anyone who's curious on how bad or great their days went throughout the year wether they need help or seen progress on how happy they have been.
